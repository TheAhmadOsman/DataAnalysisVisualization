    "## Assignment Instructions\n",
    "In this exam, there are two main parts to turn in. You will turn both in as one Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program that when run, builds a CSV file of the top 500 movies with all the data in the IMDB database plus the Adjusted Gross box office.\n",
    "A record of your work from following chapter 3 of the textbook. You must include comments as to what you are doing at each step and what you find as you are working through the chapter. \n",
    "Please read below for more details on both parts of this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part you are to write a computer program that builds your CSV file from the sources of information listed below. You should define a function called \"main\" that when called would create the file. All your code should be in the main function or should be called from the main function (you may define other functions as well if you like). \n",
    "\n",
    "You should comment this code so it is clear what you are doing. Before putting this code in your Jupyter Notebook, it will probably be best to write the program in Wing IDE 101 or PyCharm. That way you can use the debugger while running it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this program you are to compute the top grossing movies of all time from the 500 best movies. Use the IMDB database (the API to gather information) and the CPI inflation adjustment calculator. Adjust all box office amounts into August 2018 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to write the program to do this for five movies first, then expand it to the top 500 when you have figured out that you have all the right information. Build a CSV file of your results. Put this CSV file in your knuth public_html folder for yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this project/exam you will need to provide a Jupyter Notebook with your code in it to build this CSV file. However, it may be better to write this code using Wing or PyCharm to begin with. Here are the steps that are involved in building this CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the 500 best movies page and get the list of 500 movie IDs from the page. This will come in the form of a JSON file and you will have a dictionary in your program of the 500 movies.\n",
    "Open a CSV file to write your results to.\n",
    "Iterate through this list of movies and use each Id in the list to go to the OMDB API to get each movie's information. Again this will come back as JSON data so you will end up with a dictionary in your program.\n",
    "For each movie's JSON data you should see if the value of the box office is a valid float. If it is, then use the CPI calculator API to get the value of $1 in the year of the movie in August of 2018 dollars. Multiply the Box Office of the movie times this factor to get the Adjusted Gross box office value. Add this new column of data to your dictionary of the movie information. If the Box Office is not available, then still add the Adjusted Gross as 0.\n",
    "Delete the Ratings column that has the sources of all the ratings. They are duplicated from other columns anyway so they can be deleted from the dictionary.\n",
    "Write the dictionary values to a file in comma separated form. If this is the first row to be written to the file, write the keys of the dictionary first. Otherwise, just write the values to the file. The keys are the column headers and should appear as the first row in your CSV file. \n",
    "Close the file when you are all done. \n",
    "After creating this file, give it a unique name and upload it to your public_html directory on knuth so you (and I) can access it. Give it a unique name that you don't share with others but use the name in your Python notebook. Copy all the code from your working program into the Python Notebook so I can see it along with the rest of your work as you work through Chapter 3 of the Pandas Textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave out the call to your main function in your Python Notebook so the code to build the CSV never actually executes once it is in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get the program to work with five movies first before you expand this to all 500 best movies of all time because you are limited to 1000 calls to the IMDB database in a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second part, read chapter 3 of the Pandas Cookbook and apply what you read there to this problem. You may skip the final \"Calculating a trailing stop order price\" recipe on page 111 of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Pandas to explore this data using what you read in Chapter 3. Please store your CSV in your public_html director and reference it with a fully qualified name from your Python Notebook. Upload your Python notebook here with your comments as to what you are looking at in the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment/exam requires you to do some screen scraping and to read a JSON file. Your goal is to build a CSV file with the data from the IMDB web api in it (as described above) for the top 500 movies with an \"Adjusted Box Office\" amount adjusted to August 2018 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should turn in your Python Notebook here having worked through the Chapter 3 material. You should find at least one interesting thing in the data through your data analysis. You must comment on that interesting thing in Python Notebook and show how you found it. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you turn in your notebook, make sure it directly references your data on knuth and do not share the name of your CSV file with others in the class. You must access your own CSV file in this exam question but you do not need to upload the CSV file here."

    "# Interesting Things I Found After Finishing the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Christopher Nolan is the highest frequent director for the top 500 movies!\n",
    "* There are 2 beauty and the beast movies\n",
    "* The Godfather is the highest rated movie with 9.2 imdbRating and a 100 for the Metascore.\n",
    "* Metascore is the rating of critics while IMDB rating is for users on the website. \n",
    "* There is a correlation of 0.42, which is moderate, between Metascore and IMDB rating.\n",
    "* The older the movie, the higher the rating, can be seen as there is a negative correlation between Metascore/imdbRating and Year. This is stronger for critics than IMDB users.\n"
